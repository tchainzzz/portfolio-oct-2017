		        		Hello. If you're reading this, you've likely been directed here by my resume. You're probably
		        		wondering, why is there a random website here, about this "Trenton Chang?" Isn't that a little weird?
		        	
		        		The truth is, I had just taught myself how to use HTML and CSS, but I had no opportunity to use
		        		those skills in real life. I wanted to do something with the knowledge I had just gained, so I 
		        		thought — why not make a page about myself? 
		        		
		        		So in the small hours of the night, after many web tutorials, downloading some programs, and a 
		        		cup of coffee, this page was born. It turns out that my knowledge of HTML and CSS wasn't quite as
		        		solid as I had thought it was, but I overcame those obstacles to create this page: my personal about
		        		page for the world to see.
		        		
		        		<br><br>Tl;dr: I was bored. I taught myself how to make a website about myself.

			        <p>
			        	My name is Trenton, and I am currently a sophomore at Stanford University. I am majoring in
			        	American Studies.
			        	
			        	I was born in the U.S. to two immigrants from Taiwan. When I was a small child I moved
			        	to the small town of Logan, Utah, and it is there that life began for me. I lived there until I went
			            to college at Stanford University. Though my major is American Studies, I am interested in a variety 
			            of topics, from music to computer programming to languages. That's why American Studies stood out to
			            me: American Studies is an interdisciplinary field, hinting at the question, "What does it mean to be
			            American?" And that's a loaded question without an answer, but if we approach the question from a variety
			            of fields, we might be able to create something interesting to talk about. That's what I want to make my 
			            life about: creating interesting things. 
			        	
			        	<br><br>I suppose my passion for creation is pretty clear from my other interests: writing, coding, 
			        	and most of all, making music. But since you're here, I want to show you these things. Up to here I've
			        	been all talk — so if you want to see what I can do, keep scrolling down.

		        		I'm a writer. Sometime during high school, I'd discovered that writing, a subject I had long reviled in 
		        		primary school, had become a productive and enjoyable outlet for me to comment on the world. I found that
		        		I, nerd as I am, began looking forward to those in-class essays and writing assignments, for they gave me
		        		a chance to uniquely express myself and my thoughts through language. I wanted to further that passion, and
		        		so, despite my lack of experience in the area, I applied to be the editor-in-chief of the high school 
		        		newspaper, the Logan Grizzly. Somehow, I got the position. With help from my talented and dedicated team of 
		        		editors, we produced multiple print editions of the paper and kept an online version running. 
		        		
		        		<br><br> In college, I wanted to continue my work in the press, so I became a music writer. I traveled around
		        		the Bay Area periodically, covering concerts by Porter Robinson, Madeon, Zedd, and others as a member of the 
		        		press. Other weeks, I'd write about new songs, social issues in the music world, or simply music itself. My 
		        		work with the paper was a wonderful way for me to talk about my passions, and helped me strengthen my 
		        		communication skills. In the future, I'd like to broaden my horizons and talk about other salient issues: politics,
		        		social justice, and Asian-American identity.

					<p>
						Music was certainly my first love. As a pianist for 15 years, I can't remember a time before I was sitting at the
						ivory keys, plinking out tunes happily. And if you'd asked me what I wanted to be a few years ago, I would've replied,
						with utmost certainty, "A professional pianist." I must've played thousands of hours of music, famous melodies from Bach,
						Mozart, Rachmaninoff, and every composer in between. Then, I always pushed myself to play this old music in new ways. My
						piano teacher always reminded me of the question he asked himself when looking for in a great pianist: "Do they have something 
						to say?"
						
						<br><br>That's part of what drove me to create my own music. As much as I loved classical music, electronic music production
						was a space in which I could create every sound and feeling imaginable. To paraphrase one of my greatest inspirations, Flume,
						the greatest thing about making electronic music is that you can create sounds in an instant that have never been heard before 
						— by anyone. My piano keyboard has now been replaced with my computer keyboard, and I find myself with an orchestra literally 
						at my fingertips, ready to play the beautiful symphonies and melodies in my head.

		        		I was first exposed to coding my freshman year of college. I had no interest in programming prior to taking my first class, but
		        		as soon I started coding, I was hooked. It's amazing being able to create interactive programs and other things via a computer
		        		— and it always amazes me the depth and variety of possibilities the world of programming has to offer.
		        		
		        		I can't say I'm the most experienced coder, having started only half a year ago, but I can say that I've developed a passion for
		        		the type of problem-solving computer science encourages me to do. If there's something I don't know how to program, if I want to 
		        		make it, I will figure out how.
